Creating a scheduled task in Windows Task Scheduler to run a batch file is relatively straight forward. Create a batch file, open task scheduler, create a new task, add an action and create a trigger. After running the task, nohting happened. Eventually it turned out to shcedule a `.bat` file to run, I had to specify the "Start in (optional)" path when choosing which program to run. It should point to the folder containing the `.bat` file. Otherwise the `.bat` file will not run.
