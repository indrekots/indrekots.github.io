Sometimes I want to have access to all of my classes in a [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/ "Yii Framework") app externally. For example, I would like to run an external PHP script with cron and I would like to use my application classes. To achieve that, I created a separate classloader file.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

// change the following paths if necessary
$yii=dirname(__FILE__).'/../vendor/yiisoft/yii/framework/yii.php';
$config=dirname(__FILE__).'/config/console.php';
$composer = dirname(__FILE__) . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

require_once($composer);
require_once($yii);
Yii::createConsoleApplication($config);
{% endhighlight %}

This creates a Yii console application and in addition autoloads all classes managed by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Now you can use your application classes for example in a cron script.
