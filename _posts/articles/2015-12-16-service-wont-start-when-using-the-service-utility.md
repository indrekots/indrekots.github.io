Recently I learned something new and interesting. I was trying to run Mule on Ubuntu 14.04.

>Mule ESB is a lightweight Java-based enterprise service bus (ESB) and integration platform that allows developers to connect applications together quickly and easily, enabling them to exchange data.

To get the latest version I downloaded the binaries from Mule's website. Since I wanted it to be run as a service, I created the following init script (in `/etc/init.d/mule`).

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

# Set Mule related environment
MULE_HOME=/opt/mule
PATH=$PATH:$MULE_HOME/bin
RUN_AS_USER=mule

# Export environment variables
export JAVA_HOME MULE_HOME RUN_AS_USER PATH

# Invoke Mule
$MULE_HOME/bin/mule $1
{% endhighlight %}

It sets some environment variables which are needed by Mule to run. Most notably it initializes `RUN_AS_USER` to the user I want mule to run as.

When I call `service mule start` I see nothing happening. Nothing in the logs and no sign when using the `ps` command. But when calling `/etc/init.d/mule start`, Mule starts running fine.

Why is it that when calling the init script directly, Mule starts running fine but when using the service utility, nothing happens? Looking at the [startup script](https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/91f36d45a0b0744cd36f2c3037618aa7f5a655b1/distributions/standalone/src/main/resources/bin/mule "Mule startup script") for Mule, on line 419 the script is relaunched if it needs to be run as another user.

{% highlight bash %}
RELAUNCH_CMD="$REALPATH $@"
su -m $RUN_AS_USER -c "$RELAUNCH_CMD"
{% endhighlight %}

The man page for `service` says that it removes most environment variables. So my initial guess was that calling `su` depends on the environment somehow.

An excerpt from `service` man page:

>service runs a System V init script or upstart job in as predictable an environment as possible, removing most environment variables and with the current working directory set to /.

After some time spent on debugging I discovered that the user `mule` did not have a shell. It was set to `/bin/false`. The `-m` flag for `su` preserves the environment, so when I called `/etc/init.d/mule start` the `SHELL` environment variable was set and passed down to `su`.

Conversely, when calling `service mule start` the environment is cleaned. Therefore the environment did not contain a `SHELL` variable and the user `mule` did not have a shell as well. So it seems no command was executed.
