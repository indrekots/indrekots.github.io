A client of mine was unable to export data from QlikView Access Point to Excel. Instead of a spredsheet file, the web server returned the following ambiguous result.

{% highlight xml %}
<result><message text="Empty response" /></result>
{% endhighlight %}

I was able to fix it by setting the alternate temporary files folder path in QlikView Management Console. Go to System -> Setup. Select your QlikView Server and then the Folders tab. At the bottom of the page you should see the following form.

![alternate temp folder form]({{ site.url }}/images/alternate_temp_folder.png)

Make sure the folder actually exists and is writable.


Additionally make sure that `.xls` is added to the mime types list with content `application/vnd.ms-excel` in QVWS->Web.

![xls mime types list]({{ site.url }}/images/xls_mime-type.png)
