[Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io) is a framework for building [RESTful](https://www.sitepoint.com/what-does-restful-really-mean/) web services in Java. Similar to [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), Dropwizard applications are packaged into an executable *fat* JAR file. In addition to executing a Dropwizard application from the command line, you can increase your productivity by configuring your IDE to do that for you. I'm going to be looking at how to run a Dropwizard application in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/).

To execute a Dropwizard application, its `main` method needs to be called with the correct arguments. When you execute a JAR file from the command line, the JVM reads the entry point to your application from the `MANIFEST.MF` file. It contains key-value pairs and the key we're interested in is `Main-Class`. In a Dropwizard application, this is set to your `Applicaiton` class.

Equipped with this knowledge, it should be relatively easy to instruct your IDE to run a Dropwizard application during development. I'm going to be looking at how to do that in the three most popular Java IDEs based on [Zeroturnaround's Java Tools and Technologies Landscape Report 2016](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-tools-and-technologies-landscape-2016/ "Java Tools and Technologies Landscape Report 2016")

## IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open *Run/Debug Configuration* menu by selecting Run -> Edit Configurations... from the menu.
2. Add a new configuration by pressing Alt+Insert or clicking the green plus sign in the top left corner.
3. From the dropdown menu, select *Application*.
4. Add a name to the configuration.
5. Enter the fully qualified name of your main class.
6. Enter `server config.yml` to the *Program arguments* field. These are the same arguments you would pass to your application if you were running it from the command line (view image below).
7. Press Shift+F10 or select *Run* -> *Run \<your run configuration name\>* from the menu to start your Dropwizard application

## Eclipse

1. Open your project's *Run Configurations* menu by selecting *Run* -> *Run Configurations*.
2. Create a new Java Application launch configuration.
3. On the *main* tab choose a name for the configuration and specify the main class.
4. On the *arguments* tab add `server config.yml` to the program arguments text field.
5. Click the *run* button or press Ctrl+F11 to run your Dropwizard application.

## NetBeans IDE

1. Open project properties by right-clicking on the project folder in the file explorer and select *properties*.
2. Select the *Run* category from the left.
3. Enter the fully qualified name of your main class.
4. Enter `server config.yml` to the *Arguments* field and click *OK*.
5. Now you should be able to run your Dropwizard application by pressing F6 or by selecting *Run* -> *Run Project* from the menu.

## Final words

If the IDE you use is not listed here, you can still apply the same principles. The key is to instruct the IDE to call the `main` method with the desired arguments. Following the same steps it is very easy to attach a debugger as well. Instead of selecting the *run* option, you need to run the applicaiton in *debug* mode. For instance, in IntelliJ, instead of pressing Shift+F10 to run the application, press Shift+F9. In Eclipse and NetBeans the key combinations are F11 and Ctrl+F5 respectively.
